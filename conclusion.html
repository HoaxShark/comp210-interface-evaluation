          <h3>To conclude, this study has been very beneficial in highlighting issues with the controller and game, some more severe than others. It has become clear the controller and game
		  are not yet intuitive enough to just pick up, play and have a highly enjoyable experience without first understanding how to play.<br>
		  I have also clarified some problems with the data collection methods used not allowing for enough depth of insight into some issues. As thought previously having an additional 
		  qualitative method of data collection for the test subjects playing the game would be highly beneficial, making some of the issues with the controller and game more easily discoverable.<br>
		  Overall the sample sizes were too small, next time I will be looking for a size of at least twenty for the first time users tests and five for the heuristic evaluation.<br>
		  However, the final recommendations have given me more than enough work to carry on improving the controller and game for their next iteration. Hopefully providing a much better experience 
		  for the next test.
