		<h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>The Game</u></h1>
          <h3><p>Colour code is a basic reactionary video game, created by myself as a first year universtity project. 
		  The game was made to showcase a custom controller designed and made for the same project.</p>
		  <p>During the game you play as the saviour of a small innocent caterpillar, whos life is constantly in danger from moving light beams.</p>
		  <p>Using the custom controller you block the oncoming light beams in the game by placing your fingers between the corresponding LED's and light sensors. The idea is to show the correspondance
		  between blocking the light in the real world, and having that light be blocked in the virtual world. This aims to provide a innovative form of immersion for the player.</p><br></h3>

		<h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>The Research</u></h1>
		<h3><p>Two methods of research have been chosen to gather data about the game and controller.</p>
		<p>A heuristics evaluation has been conducted to look for glaring issues with both the game and controller.</p>
		<p>To choose the second method a research paper was created to find a method that would fit nicely with the aims of the research. The goal of this secondary research method was to look at how 
		easily understandable the controller and game are to players who have no prior knowledge of them.</p>
		<p>During the above mentioned paper it was deemed that task analysis would be a good way of finding the sought after data, and so was picked to be the second method.<br><br></p></h3>

		<h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>How It Looks</u></h1>
          <h3> 
		  <p>Below you can view a video of the controller and game in action to give yourself a better perspective of how it works and plays. This will greatly help when it comes 
		  to understanding some of the tasks set out later, so it is highly recommended you quickly click through some sections of the video.<br><br></p>
