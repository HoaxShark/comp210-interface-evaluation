		<h1 style="text-align:center;">The Game</h1>
          <h2><p>Colour code is a basic reactionary video game, created by myself as a first year universtity project. 
		  The game was made to showcase a custom controller designed and made for the same project.</p>
		  <p>During the game you play as the saviour of a small innocent caterpillar, whos life is constantly in danger from moving light beams.</p>
		  <p>Using the custom controller you block the oncoming light beams in the game by placing your fingers between the corresponding LED's and light sensors.</p></h2>
        </section>

		<h1 style="text-align:center;">The Research</h1>
		<h2><p>Two methods of research have been chosen to gather data about the game and controller.</p>
		<p>A heuristics evaluation has been conducted to look for glaring issues with both the game and controller</p>
		<p>To choose the second method a research paper was created to find a method that would fit nicely. The goal of this secondary research method was to look at how 
		easily understandable the controller and game are to players who have no prior knowledge of them.</p></h2>
