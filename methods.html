		<h2 style="text-align:center;">Introduction to Methods</h2>
          <h3>This report will be using two research methods to gather data about a customer controller and game made by a first year university student. 
		  The data gathered will be used to evaluate if there are any major flaws in how the current controller works, along with looking at how intuitive it is to use.</h3><br>
		  
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">First Method</h2>
		<h3>The first research method that this report is using to gather data will be task analysis, with an aim at gathering quantitative data about how 
		intuitive the controller/game are to understand without any prior knowledge of them.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">Inclusion Criteria</h2>
		<h3>To facilitate this all subjects will be checked first to make sure they know nothing about the controller/game. It will be covered up as they come in to set up 
		and the only guidance they will be given is how to open the .exe of the game. To check they subjects meet this criteria they will be asked some questions before being 
		allowed to perform the test.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">Control</h2>
		<h3>If subjects are in the same area they will be requested not to communicate any information about the test to other subjects, this will avoid any prior knowledge 
		of the controller to form for the subjects before the test. Tests will be conducted in a quiet space to avoid distraction for the subject, and only the observer will 
		be present to take notes on if they reach the set tasks without guidance.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">Data Recording</h2>
		<h3>An observer will be present during the task analysis. This person will have a set list of tasks to see if the subject completes any of them, the timestamps 
		of completion will be noted.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">Sample</h2>
		<h3>We will be gathering data from a minimum of five subjects. This is a very small sample size and should realistically be bigger, however given time and resource 
		restraints we consider this to be acceptable.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;">Tasks</h2>
		<h3> WRITE TASKS HERE </h3><br>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 style="text-align:center;">Second Method</h2>
		  <h3>As an additional form of data collection we will be running heuristic evaluations of the controller/game. Three experts will be set a list of heuristic guidelines 
		  and left with the request to give feedback on the issues they can note against the guidelines.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Inclusion Criteria</h2>
		  <h3>The chosen experts will have experience completing heuristic evaluations before. They will also have made their own custom game controllers before, as well as 
		  having knowledge about video games and their creation.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Control</h2>
		  <h3>The experts will have had some former experience with the controller as this part of the report is aiming to gather data more focused on glaring issues instead 
		  of the previous section looking at how understandable the interface is. This is to facilitate availability of experts as most people readily accessible have already 
		  seen the controller.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Data Recording</h2>
		  <h3>The experts will be given set guidelines to mark the controller against, they will be asked to do this themselves and fill out a recording sheet with as much 
		  time as they desire.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Sample</h2>
		  <h3>As mentioned we will using three experts as advised by normannorman this is to avoid wasting experts time while still getting the most out of the data.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Heuristics</h2>
