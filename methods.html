		<h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Introduction to Methods</u></h1>
          <h3><p>This report will be using two research methods to gather data about a customer controller and game made by a first-year university student. 
		  The data gathered will be used to evaluate if there are any major flaws in how the current controller works, along with looking at how intuitive it is to use.</p>
		  </h3><br>
		</section>
		<section>		  
		<h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>First Method</u></h1>
		<h3>The first research method that this report is using to gather data will be task analysis, with an aim at gathering quantitative data about how 
		intuitive the controller/game are to understand without any prior knowledge of them.<br>
		As mentioned in previously this method was picked after consideration between a few with more detail being written up in the 
		  <a href = "https://github.com/HoaxShark/COMP210_3_journal/blob/master/comp210_3_1706966.pdf">research document</a href> which is available for viewing.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Inclusion Criteria</u></h2>
		<h3>To facilitate this all subjects will be checked first to make sure they know nothing about the controller/game. It will be covered up as they come in to set up 
		and the only guidance they will be given is how to open the .exe of the game. To check the subjects meet this criteria they will be asked about their knowledge of the 
		controller and game before being allowed to perform the test.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Control</u></h2>
		<h3>If subjects are in the same area they will be requested not to communicate any information about the test to other subjects, this will avoid any prior knowledge 
		of the controller to form for the subjects before the test. Tests will be conducted in a quiet space to avoid distraction for the subject, and only the observer will 
		be present to take notes on if they reach the set tasks without guidance.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Data Recording</u></h2>
		<h3>An observer will be present during the task analysis. This person will have a set list of tasks to see if the subject completes any of them, the timestamps 
		of completion will be noted. The examiner will make it clear that they are not to interact with the test subjects in anyway before the test begins to avoid data being skewed.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Sample</u></h2>
		<h3>We will be gathering data from a minimum of five subjects. This is a very small sample size and should realistically be bigger, however given time and resource 
		restraints we consider this to be acceptable. Convenience sampling will be used again mostly due to the time restraints, but also because there are a lot of people
		available in my work environment that will be happy to do the tests.</h3><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Tasks</u></h2>
		<h3> When coming up with the tasks I made sure to consider the goal of finding how intuitive the controller is to use while also thinking about what are the most
		important tasks that the product should allow the user to complete? As mentioned <a href = "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/task-scenarios-usability-testing/">here</a href> by the Nielson and Norman Group.<br><br>
		Preliminary Questions:<br>
		Age?<br>
		Gender?<br>
		Have you seen the controller before?<br>
		<br>
		Tasks:<br>
		Time when user has correctly equipped the controller<br>
		Attempts before user has used the controller to avoid a laser<br>
		Attempts before user has used the controller to avoid a black laser<br>
		Attempts before user has used the controller to avoid a white laser<br>
		User has managed to avoid 5 lasers consecutively<br>
		Time when user decided to stop playing<br>
		High score achieved after deciding to stop<br><br>
		
		<h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Limitations</u></h2>
		<h3><p>An obvious limitation to this methodology is the sample size. Realistically five isn't enough to gather meaningful data, given more time a base sample of twenty would be a minimum.
		Another limitation is the complete lack of qualitative data that will be gathered. This stems from the tasks I have chosen and the way I have decided to record them. I did pick this purposefully
		as the second method used will be providing qualitative data, however it would be interesting to see this research done with a quick-fire interview with the subjects after if this test is done 
		again. I believe that having that more opinion orientated feedback from people who have never seen the controller would be beneficial if there was more time available.</p><p> Lastly due to the
		sampling being convenience sampling, many test subjects will likely be in the age range of 20-25, I consider this fine for such a small test, however if this was looking at a 
		larger sample size I would want to see a much more diverse age range.</p></h3>

          <h1 style="text-align:center;"><u>Second Method</u></h1>
		  <h3>As an additional form of data collection we will be running heuristic evaluations of the controller/game. Three experts will be set a list of heuristic guidelines 
		  and left with the request to give feedback on the issues they can note against the guidelines.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Inclusion Criteria</u></h2>
		  <h3>The chosen experts will have experience completing heuristic evaluations before. They will also have made their own custom game controllers before, as well as 
		  having knowledge about video games and their creation.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Control</u></h2>
		  <h3>The experts will have had some former experience with the controller as this part of the report is aiming to gather data more focused on glaring issues instead 
		  of the previous section looking at how understandable the interface is. This is to facilitate availability of experts as most people readily accessible have already 
		  seen the controller.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Data Recording</u></h2>
		  <h3>The experts will be given set guidelines to mark the controller against, they will be asked to do this themselves and fill out a recording sheet with as much 
		  time as they desire.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Sample</u></h2>
		  <h3>As mentioned we will using three experts for the evaluation. Although <a href = "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/">Nielson and Norman Group</a href>
		  recommend using five to gain the most benefit when compared to time used, I decided to drop down to three as the difference in usability problems found wasn't huge and the cohort
		  I would be asking to do these evaluations are all busy doing similar projects.</h3><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Heuristics</u></h2>
		  <h3> The heuristic seven guidelines below were cherry picked from <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5591e171e4b040c8aa3e29dc/t/55c26c6ae4b0735bb0e8fd95/1438805098302/DesigningBetterGames-09HCI-Desurvire.pdf">
		  "Game Usability Heuristics (PLAY) For Evaluating and Better Games: The Next Iteration"</a href> co-authored by Heather Desurvire and Charlotte Wiberg. These seven were chosen to discover 
		  how clear and understandable the controller and game are, as well as looking to find out if the evaluators consider them to be innovative and accurate.<br><br>
		  
		  Challenge, Strategy and Pace - Easy to learn, harder to master? Challenge, strategy and pace are in balance?<br><br>
		  Status and Score - Status score Indicators are seamless, obvious, available and do not interfere with game play?<br><br>
		  Game Provides Feedback - Game provides feedback and reacts in a consistent, immediate, challenging and exciting way to the players’ actions?<br><br>
		  Goals - The game goals are clear?<br><br>
		  Burden On Player - The game does not put an unnecessary burden on the player?<br><br>
		  Coolness/Entertainment - The game offers something different in terms of attracting and retaining the players’ interest?<br><br>
		  Players Perception of Control - The players have a sense of control and influence onto the game world?<br><br>
		  
		  <h2 style="text-align:center;"><u>Limitations</u></h2>
		<h3><p>The first issue with these heuristics is in the fact that I do not have readily available industry experts to complete the evaluations, instead I will be using other students on my course
		all of whom have created their own custom controllers and games before. Using these people as experts although great for the purpose of getting this data, I believe it won't provide as many
		issues as would be spotted by true experts.</p><p> A couple of other limitations as mentioned by Kevin Baker in <a href = "http://grouplab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/saul/681/1997/kevin/summary.html">Computer Science 681 : Research Methodologies</a href>
		are that because heuristics are quite vague in there outline the run a risk of finding one off issues. Finally, heuristics do not allow for the assessment
		of the quality of redesign ideas. </p>
